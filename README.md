# RestAPI
I used three .java files to create restAPI. RestAPIInit would run and initialize a test.db database, then a test table, in sqlite db, in actul scenerio would take in command line arguement as parameter for the .db file name (similar case for other two file; hardcoded for test purpose). The InstertApp.java I implemented functions to insert data into the table created, and the DeleteApp.java has methods to remove a table (which in this case is delete a menu section).


Here are the instructions on how to run it:
1)	To get a menu section by id //statement
2)	Get all menu sections //statement
3)	Add a new menu section/
4)	Edit a menu section //statement
5)	Delete a menu section/
